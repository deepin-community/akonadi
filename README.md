# Akonadi #

Akonadi aims to be an extensible cross-desktop storage service for PIM data
and meta data providing concurrent read, write, and query access.
It provides unique desktop-wide object identification and retrieval.

Akonadi framework provides two parts: the server, and client libraries to
access the data managed by the server.

## Client Libraries ##

stored in Akonadi, you should read the [Akonadi client libraries documentation](@ref client_libraries).
