How To Build This Template
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

--- On Linux & similar:

cd <project_name_path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make
make install or su -c 'make install'

(MY_PREFIX is where you install your Akonadi setup, replace it accordingly)

to uninstall the project:
make uninstall or su -c 'make uninstall'

Note: you can use another build path. Then cd in your build dir and:
export MY_SRC=path_to_your_src
cmake $MY_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

--- On Windows:

cd <project_name_path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%MY_PREFIX% -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
[n]make
[n]make install

(MY_PREFIX is where you install your Akonadi setup, replace it accordingly)

to uninstall the project:
[n]make uninstall

Note: use nmake if you're building with the Visual Studio compiler, or make
if you're using the minGW compiler


Implementation hints
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The code generated by the template can be compiled without any further
changes, so you can start with your own code right away.

However, there are a couple of things you will need to change outside the
serialzer's code, i.e. in the serializer's .desktop file:

- Name field

- Comment field

- Type field: MIME type of your data type
