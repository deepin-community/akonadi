Description: MySQL storage backend for Akonadi
 Akonadi is an extensible cross-desktop Personal Information Management (PIM)
 storage service. It provides a common framework for applications to store and
 access mail, calendars, addressbooks, and other PIM data.
 .
 This package installs everything what's needed for Akonadi to work with MySQL
 as underlying data storage engine. By default, a local MySQL server instance
 will be started for each user. Alternatively, connection to an external MySQL
 database is supported as well.

Description: SQLite storage backend for Akonadi
 Akonadi is an extensible cross-desktop Personal Information Management (PIM)
 storage service. It provides a common framework for applications to store and
 access mail, calendars, addressbooks, and other PIM data.

 This package installs everything what's needed for Akonadi to work with SQLite
 as underlying data storage engine. Since SQLite is an embedded database
 engine, a separate SQL server daemon is not necessary.
 .
 In addition, the package contains an improved QSql driver for SQLite named
 "QSQLite3". It can be used by any application that needs to access SQLite
 databases via standard Qt QSql framework.
