akonadi (4:17.08.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  With this version the internal Akonadi database needs to be migrated for
  every user using Akonadi. Akonadi will start the migration automatically,
  when it is started the next time. The migration step can take a longer period
  of time to start and will need a lot of ram and tmp space, because some
  database tables need to be temporarily copied.
  To see errors of the migration, you want to start akonadi by hand:
     akonadictl start or akonadictl restart
  and/or look into ~/.xsessions-errors. You may also need to set the tmpdir
  to some filesystem with more space. You can tweak the database settings under
  ~/.local/share/akonadi/ mysql.conf or other conf file for the different
  supported databases.

akonadi (1.3.1-3+squeeze1) stable-proposed-updates; urgency=low

  The location of the socket used to communicate with the Akonadi server was
  changed to better support home directories on network file systems. After
  updating to this version, applications making use of Akonadi will only
  work correctly after restarting both the Akonadi server and client
  applications.
